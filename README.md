# Cron man

I'm writing this as my first project in my journey learning golang. I'm trying to write a CLI app to read list of cron job schedules from the program config file then create a daemon to run on the system to execute. Maybe later will add a terminal interface

## TODOS

    - [x] create config file (with viper)
    
    - [] parse config file as array of scheduler
    
    - [] test execute

    - [] complete MVP

    - [] Terminal User interface
